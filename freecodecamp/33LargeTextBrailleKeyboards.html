    <h1>What Are Large Text or Braille Keyboards, and Who Uses Them?</h1>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Large text and braille keyboards are designed for users with visual disabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Large Text Keyboards (Large Print Keyboards)</h2>

    <div class="keyboard-type">
        <h3>What Are They?</h3>
        <p>In Large Text Keyboards, also called Large Print Keyboards, the letters, numbers, and symbols are larger
            compared to standard keyboards.</p>
        <p>This design is helpful for people who may find smaller text in the keys difficult to see.</p>

        <div class="feature-list">
            <h4>Key Features:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Larger letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
                <li>Enhanced contrast</li>
                <li>Increased brightness</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Examples of Large Print Keyboards</h3>

    <div class="example">
        <h4>MaxiAids Large Print Keyboard</h4>
        <p>A large print keyboard made by the brand MaxiAids has yellow keys with black, big, and bold letters, numbers,
            and symbols on them.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> This is helpful for people with low vision.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="example">
        <h4>Black Large Print Keyboard with Backlight</h4>
        <p>Another keyboard is the black large print keyboard with white print on the keys. This keyboard is also
            backlit, so users can adjust its brightness to different lighting conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Braille Keyboards</h2>

    <div class="keyboard-type">
        <h3>Tactile Experience for Severe Vision Disabilities</h3>
        <p>While large print keyboards provide visual cues for users with low vision, braille keyboards provide a
            completely tactile experience for people with more severe vision disabilities, including people who are
            blind.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="braille-info">
        <h3>What is Braille?</h3>
        <p>Braille is a tactile reading and writing system. It consists of raised dots arranged in specific patterns to
            represent letters, numbers, and punctuation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>How Braille Keyboards Work</h3>
        <p>Braille keyboards use this system to help users find the right keys on the keyboard by feeling these patterns
            with their fingers.</p>
        <p>The keys have raised dots in patterns that represent letters, numbers and symbols.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Hybrid Keyboards</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h3>Best of Both Worlds</h3>
        <p>Some keyboards combine both approaches - large fonts and braille patterns in the keys.</p>
        <p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Helpful for people with visual disabilities</li>
            <li>Helpful for people who are learning braille</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Empowering Digital Inclusion</h2>

    <div class="info-box">
        <p>Large text and braille keyboards are tools that empower people with visual disabilities.</p>
        <p>By providing alternative input methods, these assistive technologies ensure that everyone can be part of the
            digital world.</p>
