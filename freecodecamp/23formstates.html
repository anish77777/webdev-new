    <!-- 
    The default state of an input is its initial condition.
    For an email input, it is typically a blank field as first rendered.
    -->
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email-default" />

    <hr>

    <!-- 
    The focused state occurs when a user clicks on a control or tabs to it.
    Most browsers show a highlighted border (usually blue) around focused elements.
    -->
    <input type="email" name="email" id="email-focused" />

    <hr>

    <!-- 
    The disabled state prevents users from focusing or activating an input.
    It indicates that the input is currently unavailable for interaction.
    -->
    <input disabled type="email" name="email" id="email-disabled" />

    <hr>

    <!-- 
    The readonly state prevents users from editing the value of the input.
    Unlike 'disabled', a 'readonly' input can still be focused and selected.
    The 'value' attribute sets the pre-filled text.
    -->
    <input readonly type="email" name="email" id="email-readonly" value="example@email.com" />
    <input type="password" name="" id="" readonly value="example@email.com">
   
    <!-- 
    Summary: 
    - Default: Initial state (usually blank).
    - Focused: Highighted when active/selected.
    - Disabled: Cannot be focused or edited.
    - Readonly: Can be focused, but cannot be edited.
    Understanding these states ensures a smooth and clear user experience.
