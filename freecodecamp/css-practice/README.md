# CSS Practice Folder Structure

This folder contains organized CSS practice exercises. Each practice has its own folder with the following structure:

## Folder Structure

```
css-practice/
├── 01-what-is-css/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── styles.css
├── 02-next-topic/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── styles.css
└── ...
```

## Naming Convention

- Folders: `##-topic-name` (e.g., `01-what-is-css`, `02-box-model`)
- HTML file: `index.html` (main file for each practice)
- CSS file: `styles.css` (external stylesheet)
- Additional files: images, fonts, or other assets as needed

## Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: HTML and CSS are in separate files
2. **Easy Navigation**: Each topic has its own dedicated folder
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add more files (images, JS, etc.) to each practice
4. **Best Practices**: Follows industry-standard project organization

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the practice
2. Edit `styles.css` to modify the styling
3. Refresh the browser to see your changes
