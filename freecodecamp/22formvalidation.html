    What is Validation?
    It ensures users fill out information in the correct format before submission.
    
    Client-side: Happens on the user's device (browser). Handles layout and basic checks.
    Server-side: Happens on the system hosting the site. Essential for security.

        <label for="email-required">Email Address (Required field):</label>
