    <!-- AUDIO ELEMENT EXPLANATION -->
    <!-- =============================== -->

    <p>
        The <strong>audio</strong> element is used to embed sound content in an HTML
        document. It allows browsers to play audio files such as mp3, wav, and ogg
        without requiring external plugins.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>src</strong> attribute specifies the location of the audio file.
        If the audio element does not include the <strong>controls</strong>
        attribute, no audio player will be visible on the page.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>controls</strong> attribute is a boolean attribute that displays
        built-in audio controls such as play, pause, and volume.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>loop</strong> attribute makes the audio replay automatically
        after it finishes playing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>muted</strong> attribute starts the audio in a muted state until
        the user enables sound.
    </p>

    <p>
        Different browsers support different audio formats. To handle this, you can
        use multiple <strong>source</strong> elements inside the audio element, and
        the browser will play the first format it supports.
    </p>

    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
        <source src="audio.wav" type="audio/wav">
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    </audio>

    <!-- =============================== -->
    <!-- VIDEO ELEMENT EXPLANATION -->
    <!-- =============================== -->

    <p>
        The <strong>video</strong> element is used to embed video content in an HTML
        document. It supports formats such as mp4, ogg, and webm and can display both
        video and audio.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>src</strong> attribute defines the video file location, while
        <strong>controls</strong> enables playback controls like play, pause, and
        volume.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>loop</strong> attribute makes the video replay continuously after
        it ends.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>muted</strong> attribute starts the video with sound turned off.
        This is commonly required for autoplay to work in modern browsers.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>autoplay</strong> attribute starts playing the video automatically
        when the page loads.
    </p>

    <p>
        The <strong>poster</strong> attribute specifies an image that is shown before
        the video starts playing or while it is loading. This attribute is unique to
        the video element.
    </p>
