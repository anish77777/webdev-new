    <h1>What Are Alternative Pointing Devices Such as Trackballs, Joysticks, and Touchpads Used For?</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Alternative pointing devices are input devices that make good alternatives to the traditional mouse. They are
            essential for improving computer accessibility for those with disabilities, forelimb impairments, and
            limited mobility.</p>
        <p><strong>Common examples of alternative pointing devices are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Trackballs</li>
            <li>Joysticks</li>
            <li>Touchpads</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="device">
        <h3>Trackballs</h3>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h4>What is a Trackball?</h4>
            <p>A trackball is a stationary pointing device that consists of a large, movable ball within a socket. It
                also includes additional buttons for clicking and performing other functions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="features">
            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <p>Unlike the traditional mouse, which requires movement around a surface to control the cursor, a trackball
                remains in place. Users manipulate the ball directly with their fingers, thumb, or palm to move the
                cursor on the screen.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip">
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Some traditional mice also have a trackball on the top or side. These mice could make
            a good starting point if you want to gradually switch to a trackball.
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduces the physical movement the user needs for navigation</li>
                <li>Ideal for users with mobility issues</li>
                <li>Provides high precision</li>
                <li>Perfect for limited desk space</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="device">
        <h3>Joysticks</h3>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h4>What is a Joystick?</h4>
            <p>A joystick is a pointing device primarily designed for games and certain industrial applications like
                machinery control. It consists of a lever that pivots up, down, left, and right, and often includes
                additional buttons for various actions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="features">
            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <p>Joysticks provide precise control over movement and actions within digital environments. This makes them
                popular for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flight simulators</li>
                <li>Cranes</li>
                <li>Driving games</li>
                <li>Other applications requiring precise directional input</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Accommodate larger and more deliberate movements</li>
                <li>Beneficial for individuals with tremors and unsteady hands</li>
                <li>Reduce the strain and pain that comes with repetitive movements</li>
                <li>Ideal for individuals with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="device">
        <h3>Touchpads</h3>

        <div class="how-it-works">
            <h4>What is a Touchpad?</h4>
            <p>A touchpad is a flat, touch-sensitive device built into laptops and some keyboards. It allows users to
                control the cursor on the screen by sliding their fingers across its surface.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="features">
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <p>Apart from the surface for cursor control, touchpads also feature buttons that emulate the actions of a
                traditional mouse, such as right-click and left-click.</p>

            <p><strong>Multi-touch Gestures:</strong></p>
            <p>Most people see touchpads as a better alternative to a mouse because they significantly enhance
                navigation by supporting multi-touch gestures like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pinch-to-zoom</li>
                <li>Two-finger scrolling</li>
                <li>Tap-to-click</li>
                <li>Three-finger swipes</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="benefits">
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ideal for individuals with low arm or hand movement because the forelimb is almost always stationary
                    while using it</li>
                <li>Suitable for people with arthritis and joint pain because they don't get to move their arms too much
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
