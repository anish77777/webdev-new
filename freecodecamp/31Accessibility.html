    <h1>What Is Accessibility?</h1>

    <p>Accessibility involves creating products and services that everyone can use. In the context of web development,
        it's making websites that everyone can understand and interact with, including people with visual, auditory,
        motor, and cognitive disabilities.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Disabilities</h2>
    <p>Some examples of disabilities that can impact users' online experience include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blindness</li>
        <li>Low vision</li>
        <li>Color blindness</li>
        <li>Deafness</li>
        <li>Difficulty using keyboards, mice, or touchscreens</li>
        <li>Attention disorders</li>
        <li>Memory issues</li>
        <li>Difficulty speaking or understanding spoken language</li>
        <li>Sensitivity to flashing lights</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are just a few of many conditions that can impact users around the world.</p>

    <h2>WCAG - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
    <p>To help you create accessible websites, the World Wide Web Consortium, known as W3C, developed a set of
        international standards that you can follow to make your websites more accessible and easier to use for people
        with disabilities.</p>

    <p>These standards are known as the <strong>"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines" (WCAG)</strong>.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <h2>The POUR Principles</h2>
        <p>These guidelines are designed with four core principles in mind, known as <strong>POUR</strong>:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
        <h3>P - Perceivable</h3>
        <p>Users must be able to perceive the information that you are presenting.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can provide alternative text for images, so users who access your website with
            a screen reader can understand them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
        <h3>O - Operable</h3>
        <p>Users must be able to interact with the user interface.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can make sure that all functionality is accessible through the keyboard too,
            not just the mouse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
        <h3>U - Understandable</h3>
        <p>Users must be able to understand the information.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> You can avoid complex sentences and use simple language as much as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="principle">
        <h3>R - Robust</h3>
        <p>A wide range of browsers and other tools, including assistive technologies, must be able to interpret the
            content.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Using semantic HTML is very helpful for making your website compatible with
            different browsers and assistive technologies.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> If your content doesn't follow any one of these core principles, not everyone
            will be able to use your website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="reference">
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>To check if you are following these guidelines correctly, you can access the <strong>Quick Reference of the
                World Wide Web Consortium</strong>. There, you will find a comprehensive list of criteria and
            techniques.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Accessibility is essential for web development. By developing with inclusivity in mind, you can ensure that
        everyone can access and engage with your content, promote equality and create a better user experience for
        everyone around the world.</p>
