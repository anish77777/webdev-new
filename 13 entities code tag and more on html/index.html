    <!--
        If we write symbols like < and > directly,
        the browser thinks they are HTML tags, not normal text.
        Example: typing 3>4 or <p> directly can break the HTML.
    -->

    <!--
        To show these characters as text, we use HTML entities:
        >  is written as  &gt;
        <  is written as  &lt;
        &  is written as  &amp;
    -->

    <!-- apersand lt Example using entities to show comparison and tag as text -->
    <p>3 &gt; 4</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph tag&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;p&gt; this is a paragraph 2 &lt;/p&gt;</p>

    <!--
        We can also use the <code> tag to show code snippets or inline code.
        It is often combined with entities when showing HTML code.
    -->
    <p>
        Example in <code>&lt;code&gt;</code>:
        <code>&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <code>// inline code </code>
    </p>
    <!-- for this reason we use html entities -->
    <!-- pre tag print as it is-->
     <pre>      
            
            
            this is   the paragraph  </p>
     </pre>
